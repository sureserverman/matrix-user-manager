# Matrix User Manager — Announcement

Use the text below for **This Week in Matrix** (#thisweekin:matrix.org), Synapse/admin rooms, Reddit, or anywhere you want to announce the extension.

**TWIM checklist** (per [matrix.org/twim-guide](https://matrix.org/twim-guide)): post in [#thisweekin:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#thisweekin:matrix.org); start with a **mention of TWIM** (use your client’s @ mention completion); submit before **~17:00 Paris time (CET/CEST) Friday**; use Markdown in the message; optional: attach a screenshot and react with ⭕ so it’s included.

### Matrix User Manager

**Matrix User Manager** is a browser extension for Synapse server administrators. Manage your homeserver from the toolbar: add servers via domain (`.well-known` discovery), create users with username/password/display name, and manage accounts — lock, unlock, or remove users with optional media cleanup. All data is stored locally; no tracking, no telemetry, passwords never persisted. Works on Firefox (desktop and Android), Tor Browser, Mullvad Browser, and Chromium-based browsers, with light/dark theme support.
